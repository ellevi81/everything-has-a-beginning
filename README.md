i will create few scipts to practice my skills.

mark with :) every complete task. (the script has to work perfectly)


1.   Create a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.
2.   Create a program that converts a given temperature in degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit.
3.   Create a program that simulates the flipping of a coin and prints whether it landed on heads or tails.
4.   Create a program that reads a phrase from the user and determines if it is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards).
5.   Create a program that determines if a given number is prime or not.
6.   Create a program that calculates the area of a circle given the radius by the user.
7.   Create a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.
8.   Create a program that reads a list of numbers from the user and determines the largest and smallest numbers in the list.
9.   Create a number guessing game where the program chooses a random number and the user has to guess it. The program should tell the user whether their        guess is too high or too low and allow them to guess again until they guess the correct number.
10.  Create a program that generates a random password of 8 characters that includes at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit.

I hope these tasks help me practice and improve my skills in Python. Good luck! :D
